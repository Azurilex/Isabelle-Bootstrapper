# Isabelle Bootstrapper

The Isabelle Bootstrapper is an open-sourced Bootstrapper that automatically downloads file updates if a new version is found. Designed by myself- Azurilex, it takes advantage of the libcurl library for C / C++ to make web requests. I always want to help people learn, so the code has been completely commented that explains how it functions.
